# cmdtab-joke

Get funny jokes in your terminal, simply by calling the command `joke`.
If you want to save one for later, you can do so by calling `joke save`.
The previous joke will then be saved. To view all your saved jokes call
`joke list`. Should you change your mind about one joke, you can delete
it by calling `joke delete <num>`, where num corresponds to the index of
the joke shown by the list command.

Have fun...
